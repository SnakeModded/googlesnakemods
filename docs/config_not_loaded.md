# Configuration Loading Errors

The Mod Loader may display an error stating that it **failed to load external configuration**.

This error means the loader is unable to access its required configuration file. If access to this file is blocked, restricted, or your internet connection is unavailable, the mods will not load or function correctly.

### Common Causes
- No internet connection
- Network restrictions or firewalls
- Blocked access to external resources

### What You Can Do
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure external resources are not being blocked by your network or browser
- Try again later if the issue is temporary

If the problem continues, please report the issue through the project’s issue tracker with details about your setup and the error message you are seeing.
