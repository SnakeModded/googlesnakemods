# Background Images

ModLoader allows you to set a custom background image for your site using a publicly accessible image URL.

## How It Works
In the ModLoader settings, you’ll find a text field labeled **Background Image URL**. This field accepts only images that are hosted online.

⚠️ **Important:**  
You cannot use an image stored only on your local computer unless:
- You upload it to an image hosting service, **or**
- You convert it into a **data URI**

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Choose an image from a stock or wallpaper website, such as:
   - https://wall.alphacoders.com/
   - https://www.pexels.com/
   - https://unsplash.com/

2. Open the image in full resolution.

3. Right-click on the image and select **“Copy image address”**.

4. Go to **ModLoader → Settings**.

5. Paste the copied URL into the **Background Image URL** field.

6. Click **Apply** to save changes.

## Tips
- Use high-resolution images for best visual quality.
- Ensure the image URL is publicly accessible (no login required).
- Lightweight images load faster and improve performance.

That’s it! Your new background image should now be visible on the site.
