# Why do mods sometimes not work?

We now host all mods on a dedicated site where they are guaranteed to work:  
👉 [https://googlesnakemods.org/](https://googlesnakemods.org/)

From time to time, Google updates the Snake game’s code. These changes may cause some mods—or occasionally all of them—to stop working.

When this happens, we work to fix and update the affected mods. Depending on our availability and how extensive the changes are, this process may take a few days.

**Note:** All mods remain playable on [https://googlesnakemods.org/](https://googlesnakemods.org/), which preserves older, compatible versions of the game.
