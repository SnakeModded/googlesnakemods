## Why Google Snake Is So Popular

Google Snake is a modern version of the classic Snake game that many people grew up playing. Its clean design, simple controls, and instant accessibility inside the browser made it extremely popular worldwide.

As the game grew in popularity, the community began creating mods to:
- Add new game modes
- Increase replay value
- Introduce fun mechanics and challenges
- Customize gameplay beyond the original limits

## 🎯 Why We Created GoogleSnakeMods.org

Originally, Google Snake mods were shared using bookmarklets. They were easy to use, but stopped working in early 2023. Later solutions required browser extensions and scripts, which made things complicated for casual players.

**GoogleSnakeMods.org was created to solve this problem.**

Our goal is to:
- Remove the need for downloads or extensions
- Make Snake mods playable directly in the browser
- Support mobile devices
- Keep Snake mods accessible for everyone

This project is independently run by **SnakeModded** and is not affiliated with Google.
